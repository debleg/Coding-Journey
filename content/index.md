# *This is a Dev Log*

My intent is to ==**document my development as a developer**==.

## Why do this?

I won't just be developing ==websites== and other ==coding endeavours==, but also ==myself==.

[Learning in public]() has become an increasingly popular practice, and a good way to hold yourself accountable.

Here's how I intend to achieve that:

## How will this work?

<sup>If you're new to this format, hovering over the links will give you a sneak peek!</sup>

I will:
- work through personal [[Projects]]
- document what I find noteworthy in [[Snippets]]
- ~~squirrel away~~ share [[Resources]]
- run a general [[DevLog]]
- share the occasional [[Thoughts]]

<sup>Do keep in mind, what you're viewing now is also a Work In Progress!</sup>
## What will the focus be?

Currently, ==Front End Development==, prioritising:
- [[HTML]]
- [[CSS]] ([[Sass & Scss]])
- [[JavaScript]]
- the [[React framework]]

Expect also more [[Global Topics]] like [[Responsive]], [[Accessibility]], and more as I go along

## From whom?

Deb, a French thirty-something Front-End Developer currently going through a course focusing on web integration.
